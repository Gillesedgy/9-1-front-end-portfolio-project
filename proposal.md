# Frontend Profolio Project 1

### User Stories

- As a user once the page loads, I will seed a header with the title

- As a user I will see a shuffle icon, once clicked will take me to a new page displaying a random recipe

- As a user, once on the random page, there will be an icon that will take me back to the main page.

* As a user, I can type a meal name and will be presented with a list of recipes. I can also be very specific about my meal name (i.e: Arrabiata)

- As a user, I will be able to search meal names by using keywords, partial names, or letters. (i.e; hi - cHIcken, mulukHIyah, etc...)
- As a user after finding my meal, I can click on a link that will take me to a video that shows a quick how-to cooking demonstration.
