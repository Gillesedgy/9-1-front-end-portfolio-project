# Frontend Profolio Project 1

## User Stories

- As a user, When I visit the website I will see a link that will take me to a random recipe as well as an input search option.

* As a user, I can click to a link that will take me to a second page

- As a user, I can type a meal name and will be presented with a list of recipes. I can also be very specific about my meal name (i.e: Arrabiata)

* As a user, I will be bale to search meal names by using keywords, partial names, or letters. (i.e; hi - c'HI'cken, Muluk'HI'yah, etc...)

* As a user after finding my meal, I can click on a link that will take me to a video that shows a quick demo.
